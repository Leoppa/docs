## 3.3. The login page

  

The customer will get an account on the &quot;client website &quot;where he can login in order to get the access to its &quot; **Dashboard**&quot;.

  

Below, this is the interface where the customer will have to login:

In order to get an access to the personal dashboard we will ask to fill the fields with a username and a password.

The user needs to fill the field with its username and to click on Recover.


### 3.4.1. Request for a password-reset (Link 7)
  

Once the client clicked on &quot;Recover&quot;, an email has been sent with a secret code and he will be redirected to a new page where he can use that code and choose its new password.

  

## 3.5. Create a new password
