![f34](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/breadcrumb_f34.png)
_Figure 18: The breadcrumb trail after (2)_

The applicant can know the status of each step through several icons:

- The icon ![icone1](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/icone1.png) means that a step is not reachable yet.
- The icon ![icone2](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/icone2.png) shows where the applicant is on the breadcrumb trail. 
- This icon ![icone3](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/icone3.png) means that a form has not been filled or partially filled. 
- This icon ![icone4](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/icone4.png) means that a form has been completed.
- The icon ![icone5](https://github.com/everycheck/docs/blob/master/img/icone5.png) shows the final step which is the validation step.
